## 🎥 PRIMARY VEO3 PROMPTS

### Option 1: Dynamic Brand Reveal (Recommended)
```
PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT: A sleek 3-second mobile splash screen animation in vertical portrait orientation. The camera starts with a close-up of colorful confetti and festival elements (balloons, sparkles, greeting cards) floating in a vibrant gradient background transitioning from deep purple to electric blue. As the camera slowly pulls back, these elements elegantly arrange themselves into the MarketBrand logo at the center of the vertical screen. The logo materializes with a smooth glow effect, and golden particles burst outward in a circular motion. The background has subtle animated patterns of marketing posters, social media icons, and video frames flowing smoothly in the portrait frame. Professional, modern, energetic atmosphere with soft lighting and depth of field. Cinematic quality, 4K resolution, polished motion graphics style. VERTICAL PORTRAIT FORMAT 2160x3840 (4K preferred), optimized for mobile phone screens (fallback: 1080x1920 if 4K not available).
```

### Option 2: Event Marketing Energy
```
PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT: A vibrant 4-second splash screen opening in vertical portrait orientation for mobile. The scene begins with a white canvas in the center of a tall dark gradient background (navy blue to black). Suddenly, colorful design elements fly in from top and bottom - festival posters, greeting cards, business logos, video play buttons, and celebration graphics. They swirl around the canvas creating a vortex of creativity within the vertical frame. The MarketBrand wordmark fades in at the center with elegant typography, while the surrounding elements settle into a neat circular arrangement fitting the portrait layout. Soft light rays illuminate the logo from behind. Modern, professional, high-energy marketing vibe. Sharp details, smooth animation, premium brand feel rendered in 4K resolution. VERTICAL PORTRAIT 2160x3840 (4K) preferred, mobile-optimized composition.
```

### Option 3: Minimalist Professional
```
PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT: A sophisticated 3-second splash screen in vertical portrait orientation. Clean white background with subtle gradient extending top to bottom. The MarketBrand logo starts as thin outline strokes that draw themselves in with fluid motion, using a elegant pen-style animation centered in the portrait frame. As the logo completes, it fills with a vibrant gradient (purple to teal). Small animated icons appear vertically arranged around it - a poster frame above, video play button below, calendar and sparkle effects on sides - each popping in with smooth bounce animation. The icons then fade away leaving only the polished logo glowing softly in the center. Professional, clean, trustworthy aesthetic. Minimalist yet engaging. Studio lighting, crisp edges, corporate elegance rendered in 4K resolution. VERTICAL PORTRAIT 2160x3840 (4K) for mobile screens.
```

### Option 4: Festival Celebration Theme
```
PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT: A joyful 4-second splash screen celebrating creativity in vertical portrait orientation. The scene opens with a burst of colorful festival elements - diyas (oil lamps), flowers, rangoli patterns, fireworks sparkles, and celebration banners - all floating gracefully from top to bottom in a rich gradient background (saffron orange fading to deep magenta). These elements dance and swirl in a choreographed motion within the vertical frame, forming the shape of the MarketBrand logo at the center. The logo solidifies with a golden shimmer effect. Confetti falls gently from top to bottom as soft bokeh lights twinkle in the background. Indian festival aesthetic meets modern design. Warm, inviting, culturally rich atmosphere. Cinematic depth, vibrant colors, celebratory mood captured in 4K resolution. VERTICAL PORTRAIT 2160x3840 (4K), mobile-optimized for phone screens.
```

### Option 5: Tech-Forward Business
```
PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT: A modern 3-second tech splash screen in vertical portrait orientation for mobile. Dark background with animated digital grid lines and glowing nodes moving smoothly from top to bottom. The MarketBrand logo assembles piece by piece from geometric shapes and light particles centered in the portrait frame, with each letter materializing through a digital construction effect. Holographic marketing elements (floating poster templates, video thumbnails, business card designs) orbit around the logo in a 3D space within the vertical composition. Clean light streaks pass vertically across the screen. The logo pulses once with a bright glow before settling. Futuristic, professional, cutting-edge technology vibe. Sharp rendering, modern interface aesthetics, premium brand positioning in 4K resolution. VERTICAL PORTRAIT 2160x3840 (4K), optimized for mobile devices.

1. Start with the recommended prompt above
2. Generate and review the output
3. Note what works and what doesn't

### Refinement
If the first attempt needs adjustment:

**⚠️ If video is in LANDSCAPE instead of PORTRAIT (Most Critical!):**
- **Regenerate completely** with stronger emphasis on portrait mode
- Add to beginning: "CRITICAL: PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT - NOT LANDSCAPE"
- Add multiple times: "vertical portrait orientation", "2160x3840 (4K vertical)", "mobile phone screen"
- Emphasize: "This is NOT a horizontal video, this is vertical like Instagram Stories"
- Specify motion: "from top to bottom" (not left to right)
- Reference examples: "like TikTok video, like Snapchat story, vertical mobile format"

**If too busy/chaotic:**
- Add: "minimal elements", "clean composition", "slower motion"
- Remove: Some icon descriptions

**If too plain/boring:**
- Add: "dynamic motion", "energetic feel", "vibrant colors"
- Include: More animated elements

**If logo not prominent:**
- Add: "centered logo", "large prominent wordmark", "focus on brand name"
- Specify: "MarketBrand text is the main focus"

**If colors off:**
- Be more specific: "Exact hex colors: purple #6B46C1, blue #3B82F6"
- Add: "Color grading", "saturated vibrant colors"

**If motion too fast:**
- Add: "slow motion", "graceful animation", "smooth ease-in-out"
- Specify: "gentle movements, no rapid changes"

**If elements arranged horizontally (landscape layout):**
- Emphasize: "vertical arrangement", "stacked vertically", "from top to bottom"
- Specify positions: "logo centered, icons above and below (not left and right)"

## 📝 NOTES & TIPS

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Common Veo3 Portrait Mode Mistakes
**Avoid these common errors that result in landscape video:**

❌ **DON'T SAY:**
- "Create a splash screen" (without specifying portrait)
- "16:9 video"
- "Landscape format"
- "Widescreen"
- "Horizontal video"
- "1920x1080" (this is landscape!)

✅ **ALWAYS SAY:**
- "PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16"
- "Vertical portrait orientation"
- "2160x3840 (4K vertical)" (or explicitly state "highest quality vertical resolution available")
- "Mobile phone screen orientation"
- "Vertical format like Instagram Stories"
- "Portrait video, NOT landscape"

### Reinforcing Portrait Mode in Your Prompt
Add these phrases to ensure portrait orientation:
- Start prompt: "PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16 FORMAT:"
- Middle: "within the vertical frame", "from top to bottom", "portrait composition"
- End: "VERTICAL PORTRAIT 2160x3840 (4K), mobile-optimized" (note fallback to 1080x1920 if required)

### Veo3 Best Practices
- Be specific about duration (helps with pacing)
- Describe motion direction (top to bottom for portrait, not left to right)
- Mention camera movement or keep static
- Specify lighting for mood
- Use quality keywords consistently
- Reference visual styles (cinematic, commercial, etc.)
- **ALWAYS specify orientation first thing in the prompt**

### Common Issues & Fixes
- **Video in landscape instead of portrait:** ⚠️ Add "PORTRAIT MODE - VERTICAL 9:16" at the very beginning, emphasize "2160x3840 (4K vertical) NOT 1920x1080" (or "1080x1920" if 4K unavailable)
- **Video too long:** Specify "exactly 3 seconds"
- **Elements unclear:** Add "sharp focus", "4K detail"
- **Wrong colors:** Use exact hex codes in prompt
- **Jerky motion:** Request "smooth 30fps", "fluid animation"
- **Wrong aspect ratio:** State explicitly "9:16 aspect ratio, vertical portrait, NOT 16:9, NOT landscape"
- **Elements positioned for landscape:** Describe "vertical arrangement", "from top to bottom", "centered in portrait frame"

### Pro Tips
- Generate 3-5 variations and choose the best
- Consider seasonal versions for festivals
- A/B test different styles with users
- Keep file size under 5MB for quick loading
- Always have a static fallback image

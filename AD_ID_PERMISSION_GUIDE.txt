AD_ID PERMISSION GUIDE
How to Handle Google Play Console Error
========================================

🔍 WHY YOU'RE SEEING THIS ERROR:
========================================

The AD_ID permission is automatically added by:
✅ Firebase Analytics (in your app)
✅ Google Play Services
✅ Firebase BOM dependency

Located in: android/app/build.gradle line 165-166
- implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:34.0.0')
- implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'

========================================

📊 WHAT AD_ID IS USED FOR:
========================================

Firebase Analytics uses Advertising ID to:
• Track user engagement and app performance
• Measure marketing campaign effectiveness
• Provide demographic insights
• Attribution tracking (which ads led to installs)
• User behavior analytics
• Crash reporting correlation

========================================

✅ OPTION 1: KEEP IT (RECOMMENDED)
========================================

✨ Best if you want:
- User analytics
- Campaign tracking
- Performance metrics
- Understanding your audience

✅ What I Already Did:
Added explicit permission to your AndroidManifest.xml with comment

✅ What YOU Need to Do in Play Console:

1. Go to Play Console → Your App → Policy → Data Safety
2. Click "Start" or "Manage"
3. Find "Advertising ID" section
4. Select: "Yes, this app collects advertising ID"
5. Purpose: Select "Analytics" and "App functionality"
6. Data sharing: "No, data is not shared with third parties"
7. Data handling: "Data is encrypted in transit"
8. Save and submit

Then in the warning popup:
• Answer: "Yes, this app uses advertising ID"
• Submit for review

✅ Build & Upload:
cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease

========================================

❌ OPTION 2: REMOVE IT COMPLETELY
========================================

⚠️ Use only if you DON'T want any analytics

Step 1: Remove the permission from manifest
Add this to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

<manifest>
    <!-- Opt out of AD_ID permission -->
    <uses-permission 
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID"
        tools:node="remove"/>
</manifest>

Step 2: Add to manifest tag:
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"

Step 3: Disable Firebase Analytics data collection
Add to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml inside <application>:

<meta-data
    android:name="google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled"
    android:value="false" />

<meta-data
    android:name="google_analytics_ssaid_collection_enabled"
    android:value="false" />

⚠️ WARNING: This will disable:
- User analytics
- Campaign tracking
- Performance insights
- Demographics data

========================================

🔄 OPTION 3: CONDITIONAL USAGE
========================================

Keep analytics but allow users to opt-out

Add this to your app code:

import analytics from '@react-native-firebase/analytics';

// Let users disable tracking
await analytics().setAnalyticsCollectionEnabled(false);

And in manifest:
<meta-data
    android:name="google_analytics_default_allow_ad_personalization_signals"
    android:value="false" />
